# mood_forecast
Project for /hack 2016
Our hack is called Mood Forecast. The hack pulls in live Twitter data based on different locales 
and uses various natural language processing techniques and dictionaries to determine a "mood quotient".
The purpose of this hack is the use data to better society. 
With this hack, a region's well being is able to be checked and acted upon if needed. 
Different relations can be drawn from this such as a drop in our "mood quotient" due to an event.
With the addition to Amazon's Alexa's platform, we've added a voice interface to our platform. U
sers are able to interact with the data with voice controls.
